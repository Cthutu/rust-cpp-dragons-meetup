# Chris' Takeaways

> There was a significant energy in the venue that was infectious. Each talk was rammed, people sat in aisles or standing in the wings

>Observations on inclusivity align well with the goals of the Rust Foundation that is evident in their key note speech; focus on community and contribution. Like most developers, I suffer from imposter syndrome and hearing some words of encouragement as given me impetuous to find a voice in the community (again).

# Chris' Takeaways

> Channels are the best thing since default move semantics

> Magnification on security

> Rust developers are mostly hip and trendy Web devs

> The rise of machines embedded systems

# My takeaways
<!-- _class: invert-->

- the Rust community is growing fast and looking for more enterprise engagement
- The developer background of rust developers is super broad - from Go developers from the DevOps world, to ReactNative engineers doing app development.
- lots of folks want to get into Rust - some part or wholly funded themselves to come to the conference
- Rust is being used in unexpected places (Nandos app!)
- Update your compiler version _always_
