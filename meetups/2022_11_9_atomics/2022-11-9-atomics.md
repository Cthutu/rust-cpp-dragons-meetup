# **Introduction to atomics**

Lock free concurrency

---

# Introduction to Atomics

- A simple threading problem
- What are atomics
- Why do we use them
- What is ordering?!

---

## Using multiple processes

e.g. increment x

| Process 1   | Process 2   |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| get x       |             |
| increment   |             |
| store new x |             |
|             | get x       |
|             | increment   |
|             | store new x |

---
## No guarantee of order

Could cause process 1's increment to be overwritten

| Process 1   | Process 2   |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| get x       |             |
|             | get x       |
| increment   |             |
|             | increment   |
| store new x |             |
|             | store new x |

---

## Avoid data race with a lock

`x = x + 1` is not safe in a concurrent system. We could fix with a lock:

- Lock bank balance
  - Load
  - Increment
  - Store
- Release lock

---
## If we didn't have mutexes?

- load, modify, and store are three separate operations
- we need a single uninterruptible operation
- an **'atomic operation'**

---

# What is an 'atomic operation'

### Atomic

> _atomic (adj.)_
> _pertaining to atoms,"_


### Atom

> _from Greek atomos "uncut, unhewn; **indivisible**,"_


---
<!-- _class: lead -->

 ### no other thread will be able to see the state of a system part way through an atomic operation

---

## What is an 'atomic operation'

Replace multiple operations which could be 'interrupted' by another thread, with single atomic operations

Usually we're talking about atomic operations at the hardware level

Are all CPU instructions atomic? Is write atomic?

---

### Are all CPU instructions atomic?

- Not always 🥲
- On some platforms, we could read a half written x
-  on x86, a 32-bit `mov` instruction is atomic if the memory operand is naturally aligned, but non-atomic otherwise
- `strd r0, r1, [r2]` - Store Register Dual immediate is not necessarily atomic

<!-- In other words, atomicity is only guaranteed when the 32-bit integer is located at an address which is an exact multiple of 4 https://preshing.com/20130618/atomic-vs-non-atomic-operations/ -->


---

## How can we make sure our operations are atomic?

```rust
let counter = AtomicUsize::new(0);
```

```rust
counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);
```
---

### What is an 'atomic operation'

- `x = x + 1` - probably not atomic
- `x += 1` - maybe atomic?
- `fetch_add` - atomic

---

### Atomic types

|             |             |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| AtomicI8    | AtomicU8    |
| AtomicI16   | AtomicU16   |
| AtomicI32   | AtomicU32   |
| AtomicI64   | AtomicU64   |
| AtomicIsize | AtomicUsize |
| AtomicBool  |
| AtomicPt    |

---

### AtomicU32 Operations

|                       |              |       |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| compare_exchange      | fetch_nand   | load  |
| compare_exchange_weak | fetch_or     | new   |
| fetch_add             | fetch_sub    | store |
| fetch_and             | fetch_update | swap  |
| fetch_max             | fetch_xor    |
| fetch_min             | into_inner   |
| get_mut               |

### Implement a spin lock _(do not use)_

Premise: Use an atomic bool to lock some data

```rust
struct SpinLockedInt {
    locked: AtomicBool,
    value: UnsafeCell<f32>,
}
```
After implementing a spin lock will be able to lock a value which isn't atomic, and unlock it to modify safely:
```rust
let mut lock = value.lock();
*lock += 1;
```
---
### Implement a spin lock

1. Implement lock method on SpinLock - tries to lock data and returns a lock guard when it succeeds
2. Implement SpinLockGuard - provide access to underlying data and unlock the data when dropped
3. Once we're happy the threading works, implement `Sync`
4. Use `Deref` and `MutDeref` traits to make spin lock guard more friendly
5. Improve lock method (ordering)

---

### 1.1 Implement lock method on SpinLock - 1st pass

**BUG**

```rust
pub fn lock_badly(&self) -> SpinLockGuard<'_> {
    // Spin until lock is available
    while self.locked.load(Ordering::Relaxed) != UNLOCKED {
        thread::yield_now(); // allow other threads to get in the way
    }
    self.locked.store(LOCKED, Ordering::Relaxed);

    SpinLockGuard { spin_lock: self }
}
```

---
### 1.1 Implement lock method on SpinLock - Improved

_ignore ordering for now_

```rust
pub fn lock(&self) -> SpinLockGuard<'_> {
    // Swap returns the previous value. If the previous value
    // was locked, we keep spinning, if it was unlocked, we set locked
    // in and break the while loop
    while self.locked.swap(LOCKED, Ordering::Relaxed) {
        thread::yield_now(); // allow other threads to get in the way
    }
    SpinLockGuard { spin_lock: self }
}
```
Could have used `compare_and_swap` instead of `swap`

---

#### 2.1 Implement lock guard - provide access to underlying data

```rust
struct SpinLockGuard<'a> {
    spin_lock: &'a SpinLockedInt,
}

impl SpinLockGuard {
    fn get(&self) -> &Self::Target {
        unsafe { &*self.spin_lock.value.get() }
    }

  fn get_mut(&mut self) -> &mut Self::Target {
          unsafe { &mut *self.spin_lock.value.get() }
      }
}
```

---
#### 2.2 Implement lock guard - unlock the data when dropped

_ignore ordering for now_

```rust
impl Drop for SpinLockGuard<'_> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        self.spin_lock.locked.store(UNLOCKED, Ordering::Relaxed);
    }
}
```
---
#### 3. Once we're happy the threading works, implement `Sync`

`UnsafeCell` is not `Sync`, because it provides zero protection against data races - they enable unsynchronized shared mutable state.

We have ensured SpinLockedInt is safe to share with our lock, so can mark it `Sync`

```rust
struct SpinLockedInt {
    locked: AtomicBool,
    value: UnsafeCell<f32>,
}

// Unsafe Sync impl means: "Trust me, I will make sure concurrent access is safe"
unsafe impl Sync for SpinLockedInt {}
```
---
#### 4. Use `Deref` and `MutDeref` traits to make spin lock guard more friendly

```rust
impl Deref for SpinLockGuard<'_> {
    type Target = f32;

    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {
        unsafe { &*self.spin_lock.value.get() }
    }
}

impl DerefMut for SpinLockGuard<'_> {
    fn deref_mut(&mut self) -> &mut Self::Target {
        unsafe { &mut *self.spin_lock.value.get() }
    }
}
```
---

#### 5. Improve lock method (ordering)

Why? It works already! Probably...

---

#### Compiler Reordering

The compiler can reorder things, and remove code as it sees fit

```rust
x = 1;
y = 3;
x = 2;
```

```rust
x = 2;
y = 3;
```

In C++ the keyword `volatile` is used to indicated values which can change to try to mitigate against optimizations which cannot be applied in multithreaded contexts.

---

#### Hardware Reordering (even if compiler doesn't reorder)
```
initial state: x = 0, y = 1

THREAD 1        THREAD2
y = 3;          if x == 1 {
x = 1;              y *= 2;
                }
```
Possible outcomes:
- `y = 3`: (thread 2 did the check before thread 1 completed)
- `y = 6`: (thread 2 did the check after thread 1 completed)
- Or `y = 2`: (thread 2 saw x = 1, but not y = 3, and overwrote y = 3)

---

#### Hardware Reordering

Depending on the hardware, we might get different guarantees about what can and can't happen.

- x86/64 provides strong ordering guarantees (for now...?)
- ARM provides weak ordering guarantees

---

#### Ordering Options

```rust
pub enum Ordering {
    Relaxed,
    Release,
    Acquire,
    AcqRel,
    SeqCst,
}
```

---
#### `Ordering::Relaxed`

> No ordering constraints, only atomic operations.
> Corresponds to [`memory_order_relaxed`] in C++20.

_Rust Doc_

> there are no synchronization or ordering constraints imposed on other reads or writes, only this operation's atomicity is guaranteed

_cpp reference_

---
## Relaxed Ordering example

Starting with `y=0` and `x=0`
```cpp
// Thread 1:
r1 = y.load(std::memory_order_relaxed); // A - set r1 to y
x.store(r1, std::memory_order_relaxed); // B - set x to r1
// Thread 2:
r2 = x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed); // C - set r2 to x
y.store(42, std::memory_order_relaxed); // D - set y to 42
```

Can give

```
r1 == r2 == 42
```

---
#### `Ordering::Release`

A **store** operation with this memory order performs the release operation:
- no reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered after this store. 
- All writes in the current thread are visible in other threads **that acquire the same atomic variable** (see Release-Acquire ordering below) and writes that carry a dependency into the atomic variable become visible in other threads that consume the same atomic.

---
#### `Ordering::Acquire`

A load operation with this memory order performs the acquire operation on the affected memory location:
- no reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered before this load. 
- All writes in other threads **that release the same atomic variable** are visible in the current thread (see Release-Acquire ordering below)

---
```cpp
std::atomic<std::string*> ptr;
int data;
 
void producer()
{
    std::string* p  = new std::string("Hello");
    data = 42;
    ptr.store(p, std::memory_order_release);
}
 
void consumer()
{
    std::string* p2;
    while (!(p2 = ptr.load(std::memory_order_acquire)))
        ;
    assert(*p2 == "Hello"); // never fires
    assert(data == 42); // never fires
}
 
int main()
{
    std::thread t1(producer);
    std::thread t2(consumer);
    t1.join(); t2.join();
}
```
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order#Release-Acquire_ordering


---

#### `Ordering::AcqRel`

A read-modify-write operation with this memory order is both an acquire operation and a release operation:
- No memory reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered before the load, nor after the store.
- All writes in other threads that release the same atomic variable are visible before the modification and the modification is visible in other threads that acquire the same atomic variable.

---

#### `Ordering::SeqCst`

- a load operation with this memory order performs an acquire operation, 
- a store performs a release operation, 
- a read-modify-write performs both an acquire operation and a release operation,
- plus **a single total order exists** in which all threads observe all modifications in the same order

---

## A good rule of thumb

- If multiple threads concurrently access a mutable variable, then ALL threads must use atomic operations to read or write to it

---

## Conclusions

- Atomics are a bit subtle
- Memory is weird
- Time is an illusion
