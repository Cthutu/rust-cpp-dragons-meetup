# Readme

Backed up content is organised chronologically by meetup. Each meetup has it's
own directory. At the very least it should include a link to an uploaded youtube
video, but where possible we have included presenter notes and slides.

Book club related meetups are separated into their own directory for the
specific book.

If you think something's missing, or if you gave a presentation in the past and
your slides and/or notes are missing, please raise a PR so we can look into it.
