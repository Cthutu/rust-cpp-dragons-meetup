## FAQ's

### I would like to volunteer to give a talk, or lead a book club chapter. How do I make myself known?

You can raise a PR and outline exactly what you'd like to talk about. You can
also use the PR to add your own slides and any other resources you'd like to be
made accessible for the presentation.

### I would like to suggest a talk topic for the group to give. How do I make my interest known?

As above, raise a PR and ask for it. We'll be happy to discuss it with you.
